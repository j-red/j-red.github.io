A collection of my recent works made in Blender 3D.

Below are some additional examples of 3D projects I have created. All of these projects were created in Blender 3D with some additional texture and asset creation done in Substance Painter. Reach out if you have any questions!

My most recent project, this was a set of stereo headphones inspired by the 1969 Panasonic FM Stereo Headset RF-60 Model. I created and UV mapped the model in Blender, and designed the textures in substance painter.

I created this realistic ocean scene using a combination of EXR wave displacement data and several layers of procedural noise to control the clumping and intensity of the waves. The scene was rendered in Cycles in Blender 3D overnight on a laptop that was not very happy with me!

I also created this stylized water shader in Blender, this time using layers of Voronoi textures and procedural noise displacement to create the shading and gradient effects.

This scene low-poly scene made heavy use of Blender's Shader-to-RGB node, which helped create the specular highlights on the glass bottle.

I created this model of a classic Nintendo GameBoy to try my hand at hard-surface modeling and photorealistic rendering. Using technical blueprints from [dimensions.com](https://www.dimensions.com/element/game-boy), I was able to create a model from scratch that served as a to-scale 3D replica. I then textured the model in Substance Painter, with some additional textures used for the fingerprint smudging on the screen.

I create this NPR (non-photorealistic rendering) stylized sci-fi mask to further develop my skills with hard-surface modeling in tandem with a more stylized rendering style. The base model was sculpted by hand, with the rest created procedurally using Blender's modifier stack.

I also tried a simple turnaround render with this mask using some materials I created in Substance Painter.

And lastly, I created a 2D looping animation of rotating eyes. While this was nowhere near the most complex 3D rendering I've done to date, it was still an interesting project, as I used only one instance of the eye mesh and used post-process scripting to separate the R, G, and B channels and rotate them about the origin.
