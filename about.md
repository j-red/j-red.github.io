Hello! My name's Jared, I'm a freelance technical artist and Ph.D. student from the Pacific Northwest. I graduated from the University of Oregon with a degree in **Math**, **Computer Science**, and **Music Technology** in March 2022, but am currently on hiatus from my Ph.D. seeking to develop my portfolio and find a full-time position in the technical art industry.

During my education, I received several awards and honors, including membership in the 
<a href="https://www.pbk.org/" target="_blank">Phi Beta Kappa</a> Honors Society, the
<a href="https://cs.uoregon.edu/activities/awards-and-honors/phillip-seeley-graduate-fellowship" target="_blank">Phillip Seeley Graduate Fellowship</a>, the 
<a href="https://ubri.ripple.com/" target="_blank">Ripple UBRI Scholarship</a>, the
<a href="https://research.uoregon.edu/apply/apply-internal-funding/vpri-fellowship" target="_blank">UO VPRI Fellowship</a>, and 
[more](/awards).

For more information or examples of my work, check out my [portfolio](/portfolio) and [blog](/blog). Feel free to contact me at [jared@cs.uoregon.edu](mailto:jared@cs.uoregon.edu)if you have any questions!
