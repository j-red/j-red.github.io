## [Combating Covid on College Campuses](https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/33611), altREU.

A computational modeling simulation of airborne pathogen transmission in academic spaces demonstrating the importance of ventilation and social distancing in scholastic settings. Research conducted as part of the Summer 2020 altREU program at Portland State University. 
This research was conducted in collaboration with myself, Oregon Health & Science University faculty, and three other undergraduate across the U.S.

The final report from this program is available on the Portland State University Library Archive, available [here](https://archives.pdx.edu/ds/psu/33611).
